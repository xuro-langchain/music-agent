    "This customer support chatbot interacts with SQL database to answer questions.\n",
    "We will use a mock SQL database to get started: the [Chinook](https://www.sqlitetutorial.net/sqlite-sample-database/) database.\n",
    "This database is about sales from a music store: what songs and albums exists, customer orders, things like that.\n",
    "\n",
    "This chatbot has two different states: \n",
    "1. Music: the user can inquire about different songs and albums present in the store\n",
    "2. Account: the user can ask questions about their account\n",
    "\n",
    "Under the hood, this is handled by two separate agents. \n",
    "Each has a specific prompt and tools related to their objective. \n",
    "There is also a generic agent who is responsible for routing between these two agents as needed."
